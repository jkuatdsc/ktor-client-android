## Ktor In Android

# This repo is for the ktor in android session 

Before trying out the OAuth2 part you need a client secret and Id that you can get from the google cloud console.
Find the constants file inside the data package (constants.kt).
Just make sure to also add the gmail scope and also configure you consent screen in the console.
